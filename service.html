                    Anesthesia or anaesthesia (from Greek "without sensation")
                    is a state of controlled, temporary loss of sensation or
                    awareness that is induced for medical purposes. It may
                    include some or all of analgesia (relief from or prevention
                    of pain), paralysis (muscle relaxation), amnesia (loss of
                    memory), and unconsciousness. A patient under the effects of
                    anesthetic drugs is referred to as being anesthetized.

                  <p>
                    Anesthesia enables the painless performance of medical
                    procedures that would otherwise cause severe or intolerable
                    pain to an unanesthetized patient, or would otherwise be
                    technically unfeasible. Three broad categories of anesthesia
                    exist:

                    <li class="list-group-item border-0">
                      • General anesthesia suppresses central nervous system
                      activity and results in unconsciousness and total lack of
                      sensation, using either injected or inhaled drugs.
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-group-item border-0">
                      • Sedation suppresses the central nervous system to a
                      lesser degree, inhibiting both anxiety and creation of
                      long-term memories without resulting in unconsciousness.
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-group-item border-0">
                      • Regional and local anesthesia, which blocks transmission
                      of nerve impulses from a specific part of the body.
                      Depending on the situation, this may be used either on its
                      own (in which case the patient remains fully conscious),
                      or in combination with general anesthesia or sedation.
                      Drugs can be targeted at peripheral nerves to anesthetize
                      an isolated part of the body only, such as numbing a tooth
                      for dental work or using a nerve block to inhibit
                      sensation in an entire limb. Alternatively, epidural and
                      spinal anesthesia can be performed in the region of the
                      central nervous system itself, suppressing all incoming
                      sensation from nerves supplying the area of the block.

                  <p>
                    In preparing for a medical procedure, the clinician chooses
                    one or more drugs to achieve the types and degree of
                    anesthesia characteristics appropriate for the type of
                    procedure and the particular patient. The types of drugs
                    used include general anesthetics, local anesthetics,
                    hypnotics, dissociatives, sedatives, adjuncts,
                    neuromuscular-blocking drugs, narcotics, and analgesics.

                  <p>
                    The risks of complications during or after anesthesia are
                    often difficult to separate from those of the procedure for
                    which anesthesia is being given, but in the main they are
                    related to three factors: the health of the patient, the
                    complexity (and stress) of the procedure itself, and the
                    anaesthetic technique. Of these factors, the health of the
                    patient has the greatest impact. Major perioperative risks
                    can include death, heart attack, and pulmonary embolism
                    whereas minor risks can include postoperative nausea and
                    vomiting and hospital readmission. Some conditions, like
                    local anesthetic toxicity, airway trauma or malignant
                    hyperthermia, can be more directly attributed to specific
                    anesthetic drugs and techniques.

                    Electrocardiography is the process of producing an
                    electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). It is a graph of voltage
                    versus time of the electrical activity of the heart using
                    electrodes placed on the skin. These electrodes detect the
                    small electrical changes that are a consequence of cardiac
                    muscle depolarization followed by repolarization during each
                    cardiac cycle (heartbeat). Changes in the normal ECG pattern
                    occur in numerous cardiac abnormalities, including cardiac
                    rhythm disturbances (such as atrial fibrillation and
                    ventricular tachycardia), inadequate coronary artery blood
                    flow (such as myocardial ischemia and myocardial
                    infarction), and electrolyte disturbances (such as
                    hypokalemia and hyperkalemia).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a conventional 12-lead ECG, ten electrodes are placed on
                    the patient's limbs and on the surface of the chest. The
                    overall magnitude of the heart's electrical potential is
                    then measured from twelve different angles ("leads") and is
                    recorded over a period of time (usually ten seconds). In
                    this way, the overall magnitude and direction of the heart's
                    electrical depolarization is captured at each moment
                    throughout the cardiac cycle.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are three main components to an ECG: the P wave, which
                    represents the depolarization of the atria; the QRS complex,
                    which represents the depolarization of the ventricles; and
                    the T wave, which represents the repolarization of the
                    ventricles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During each heartbeat, a healthy heart has an orderly
                    progression of depolarization that starts with pacemaker
                    cells in the sinoatrial node, spreads throughout the atrium,
                    and passes through the atrioventricular node down into the
                    bundle of His and into the Purkinje fibers, spreading down
                    and to the left throughout the ventricles. This orderly
                    pattern of depolarization gives rise to the characteristic
                    ECG tracing. To the trained clinician, an ECG conveys a
                    large amount of information about the structure of the heart
                    and the function of its electrical conduction system. Among
                    other things, an ECG can be used to measure the rate and
                    rhythm of heartbeats, the size and position of the heart
                    chambers, the presence of any damage to the heart's muscle
                    cells or conduction system, the effects of heart drugs, and
                    the function of implanted pacemakers.

                    Clinical psychology is an integration of science, theory,
                    and clinical knowledge for the purpose of understanding,
                    preventing, and relieving psychologically-based distress or
                    dysfunction and to promote subjective well-being and
                    personal development. Central to its practice are
                    psychological assessment, clinical formulation, and
                    psychotherapy, although clinical psychologists also engage
                    in research, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and
                    program development and administration. In many countries,
                    clinical psychology is a regulated mental health profession.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The field is generally considered to have begun in 1896 with
                    the opening of the first psychological clinic at the
                    University of Pennsylvania by Lightner Witmer. In the first
                    half of the 20th century, clinical psychology was focused on
                    psychological assessment, with little attention given to
                    treatment. This changed after the 1940s when World War II
                    resulted in the need for a large increase in the number of
                    trained clinicians. Since that time, three main educational
                    models have developed in the USA—the Ph.D. Clinical Science
                    model (heavily focused on research), the Ph.D.
                    science-practitioner model (integrating scientific research
                    and practice), and the Psy.D. practitioner-scholar model
                    (focusing on clinical theory and practice). In the UK and
                    the Republic of Ireland, the Clinical Psychology Doctorate
                    falls between the latter two of these models, whilst in much
                    of mainland Europe, the training is at the masters level and
                    predominantly psychotherapeutic. Clinical psychologists are
                    expert in providing psychotherapy, and generally train
                    within four primary theoretical orientations—psychodynamic,
                    humanistic, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and systems
                    or family therapy.

Although primarily associated with teeth among the general public, the field of dentistry is not limited to teeth but includes other aspects of the craniofacial complex including the temporomandibular joint and other supporting, muscular, lymphatic, nervous, vascular and anatomical structures.

                    Medicine has been practiced since prehistoric times, during
                    most of which it was an art (an area of skill and knowledge)
                    frequently having connections to the religious and
                    philosophical beliefs of local culture. For example, a
                    medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing,
                    or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply
                    bloodletting according to the theories of humorism. In
                    recent centuries, since the advent of modern science, most
                    medicine has become a combination of art and science (both
                    basic and applied, under the umbrella of medical science).
                    While stitching technique for sutures is an art learned
                    through practice, the knowledge of what happens at the
                    cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched
                    arises through science.

                    Prescientific forms of medicine are now known as traditional
                    medicine and folk medicine. They remain commonly used with,
                    or instead of, scientific medicine and are thus called
                    alternative medicine. As an example, evidence on the
                    effectiveness of acupuncture is "variable and inconsistent"
                    for any condition, but is generally safe when done by an
                    appropriately trained practitioner. In contrast, alternative
                    treatments outside the bounds not just of scientific
                    medicine, but also that of safety and efficacy are termed
                    quackery. This can encompass an array of practices and
                    practitioners, irrespective of whether they are
                    prescientific (traditional medicine and folk medicine) or
                    modern pseudo-scientific, including chiropractic which
                    rejects modern scientific germ theory of disease (instead
                    believing without evidence that human diseases are caused by
                    invisible subluxation of the bones, predominantly of the
                    spine and less so of other bones), with just over half of
                    chiropractors also rejecting the science of immunization.

                    Pediatrics (also spelled paediatrics or pædiatrics) is the
                    branch of medicine that involves the medical care of
                    infants, children, and adolescents. The American Academy of
                    Pediatrics recommends people be under pediatric care through
                    the age of 21 (though usually only minors are required to be
                    under pediatric care). In the United Kingdom, pediatrics
                    covers patients until age 18. Worldwide age limits of
                    pediatrics have been trending up year over year. A medical
                    doctor who specializes in this area is known as a
                    pediatrician, or paediatrician. The word pediatrics and its
                    cognates mean "healer of children"; they derive from two
                    Greek words: παῖς (pais "child") and ἰατρός (iatros "doctor,
                    healer"). Pediatricians work in hospitals and children's
                    hospitals particularly those working in its subspecialties
                    (e.g. neonatology), and as outpatient primary care
                    physicians.

                    Public health has been defined as "the science and art of
                    preventing disease”, prolonging life and improving quality
                    of life through organized efforts and informed choices of
                    society, organizations (public and private), communities and
                    individuals. Analyzing the determinants of health of a
                    population and the threats it faces is the basis for public
                    health. The public can be as small as a handful of people or
                    as large as a village or an entire city; in the case of a
                    pandemic it may encompass several continents. The concept of
                    health takes into account physical, psychological, and
                    social well-being. As such, according to the World Health
                    Organization, it is not merely the absence of disease or
                    infirmity and more recently, a resource for everyday living.

                  <p>
                    Public health is an interdisciplinary field. For example,
                    epidemiology, biostatistics, social sciences and management
                    of health services are all relevant. Other important
                    sub-fields include environmental health, community health,
                    behavioral health, health economics, public policy, mental
                    health, health education, health politics, occupational, gender issues in health, and sexual and reproductive health.

                  <p>
                    Public health aims to improve the quality of life through
                    prevention and treatment of disease, including mental
                    health. This is done through the surveillance of cases and
                    health indicators, and through the promotion of healthy
                    behaviors. Common public health initiatives include
                    promotion of hand-washing and breastfeeding, delivery of
                    vaccinations, suicide prevention, smoking cessation, obesity
                    education, increasing healthcare accessibility and
                    distribution of condoms to control the spread of sexually
                    transmitted diseases.

                  <p>
                    Modern public health practice requires multidisciplinary
                    teams of public health workers and professionals. Teams
                    might include epidemiologists, biostatisticians, physician
                    assistants, public health nurses, midwives, medical
                    microbiologists, pharmacists, economists, sociologists,
                    geneticists, data managers, environmental health officers
                    (public health inspectors), bioethicists, gender experts,
                    sexual and reproductive health specialists, physicians, and
                    even veterinarians.

                    Physiotherapy is a physical medicine and rehabilitation
                    specialty that re mediates impairments, manages pain and

                    is a state of complete physical, mental and social
                    well-being and not merely the absence of disease or
                    infirmity.” It was initially brought to use in the US by
                    Halbert L. Dunn, M.D. in the 1950s; Dunn was the chief of
                    the National Office of Vital Statistics and discussed
                    “high-level wellness,” which he defined as “an integrated
                    method of functioning, which is oriented toward maximizing
                    the potential of which the individual is capable.” The term
                    "wellness" was then adopted by John Travis who opened a
                    "Wellness Resource Center" in Mill Valley, California in the
                    mid-1970s, which was seen by mainstream culture as part of
                    the hedonistic culture of Northern California at that time
                    and typical of the Me generation. Travis marketed the center
                    as alternative medicine, opposed to what he said was the
                    disease-oriented approach of medicine. The concept was
                    further popularized by Robert Rodale through Prevention
                    magazine, Bill Hetler, a doctor at University of
                    Wisconsin–Stevens Point, who set up an annual academic
                    conference on wellness, and Tom Dickey, who established the
                    Berkeley Wellness Letter in the 1980s. The term had become
                    accepted as standard usage in the 1990s.
